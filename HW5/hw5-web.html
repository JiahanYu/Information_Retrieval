  <div class="row"> <h2>Homework #5 &#187; Web Search Engine for Computer Science</h2>

  <P>This homework is an alternative assessment (in place of the exam) for the exchange students.</P>

<h3>Commonalities with Homeworks #2 and #3</h3>

<p> The indexing and query commands will use an <span
class="text-error">(almost)</span> identical input format to Homeworks
#2 and #3, so that you need not modify much of your code to deal with
command line processing. To recap: </p>

<p><b>Indexing:</b> <code>$ python index.py -i directory-of-documents
-d dictionary-file -p postings-file</code><br>
</p>
<p><b>Searching:</b> <code>$ python search.py -d dictionary-file -p
postings-file -q query-file -o output-file-of-results</code><br>
</p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="text-error">The minor difference from Homeworks #2 and #3 is 
that <code>query-file</code> specifies a single query instead of a list of
queries.</SPAN></p>

<p>However, significantly different from the previous homework, you 
will need to collect a set of webpages on Computer Science topics for your system. </p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><b>Problem Statement</b>: Given 1) a set of webpages on Computer 
Science topics (to be collected on your own) as the candidate document collection 
to retrieve from, and 2) a set of queries, return the list of the IDs and the URLs of
the relevant documents for each query, in sorted order of relevance.
Your search engine should return the entire set of relevant documents
(don't threshold to the top <I>K</I> relevant documents). </p>

<p><span class="text-error">Your system should return the results for the
query <code>query-file</code> on multiple lines.</span> Each line contains
 the ID and the URL of the document, separated by a single space ' '. Return an empty line
if no documents are relevant.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>For this assignment, no holds are barred. You may use any type of
preprocessing, post-processing, indexing and querying process you
wish.  You may wish to incorporate or use other python libraries or
external resources. However, for python libraries, you'll have to
include them with your submission properly -- We will not install new
libraries to grade your submissions. Moreover, more credits will be given 
if you are implementing the features on your own instead of using existing 
libraries / resources. Please indicate clearly in your documentation which part is implemented by 
you and which part is done using existing libraries / resources.
</p>

<h3>Techniques for Retrieval</h3>

<P>You are required implement PageRank, as well as one other technique (e.g., Zones and Fields or Query Refinement)
 in your system. Document the details of your implemenation and evaluation of the techniques in your report. </P>
 
<P>Nevertheless, do focus on the textual content of the webpage. There is no need to deal with the images, videos and scripts.</P>

<h3>More details on the Queries and the Documents</h3>

<P><b>Queries:</b></P>

<P> The queries are free text queries, such as <i>pagerank examples</i> and 
<i>"information retrieval" textbook</i>. The keywords enclosed in double quotes 
are meant to be searched as a phrase. The phrases in the queries are 2 or 3 words 
long, max; so you if you are able to deal with phrasal queries, you can support 
them using n-word indices or with positional indices.</p>

<p><b>Documents:</b></p>

<P>You should collect 2000 webpages on Computer Science topics, possibly
 using the crawling algorithm introduced in the lecture. </P>

<P>The files in the collection should be named by their document IDs, which should be an integer between 1-2000. </P>

<P>Since you are required to implement PageRank, you should make sure that the webpages collected 
are mostly linked (so that the graph is not full of isolated nodes).</P>

<h3>What to turn in?</h3>

<p>For the system, you are required to submit <CODE>index.py</CODE>, <CODE>search.py</CODE>,
<CODE>dictionary.txt</CODE>, <CODE>postings.txt</CODE> and a few sample query files (e.g., <CODE>q1.txt</CODE>) for running your system.</p>

<p>You <span class="text-error">do not</span> need to include documentation collection but you should make it available 
for downloading until the end of May. </p>

<p>For the documentation, you are required to submit <CODE>README.txt</CODE> and other supplementary documentations (if any). </p>

<h3>Submission Formatting</h3>

<p>You are required to do this assignment <b>individually</b>. </p>

<p>For us to grade this assignment in a timely manner, we need you to
adhere strictly to the following submission guidelines. They will help
me grade the assignment in an appropriate manner. <span
class="text-error">You will be penalized if you do not follow these
instructions.</span> Your student number in all of the following
statements should not have any spaces and any letters should be in
CAPITALS. You are to turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A plain text documentation file <code>README.txt</code>: this is
  a text only file that describes any information you want me to know
  about your submission. (Don't forget to include instructions for downloading the document collection.)
  You <span class="text-error">should
  not</span> include any identifiable information about your
  assignment (your name, phone number, etc.) except your student number
  and email (we need the email to contact you about your grade, please
  use your e*******@u.nus.edu address, not your email alias). This is
  to help you get an objective grade in your assignment, as we won't
  associate student numbers with student names.  <strong>You should use
  the <code>README.txt</code> template given to you in Homework #1 as
  a start.  In particular, you need to assert whether you followed
  class policy for the assignment or not.</strong></li>

  <li>All source code. We <span class="text-error">will</span> be
  reading your code, so please do us a favor and format it nicely.
  Again, if you're using external libraries, make sure to include them
  properly so that your submission can be evaluated without hassles (and
  acknowledge your external libraries as a source of help in your
  submission).</li>
  </ul>

<p>These files will need to be suitably zipped in a single file called
<code>&lt;student number&gt;.zip</code>. Please use a zip archive and
not tar.gz, bzip, rar or cab files. Make sure when the archive unzips
that all of the necessary files are found in a directory called
<code>&lt;student number&gt;</code>. Upload the resulting zip file to
LumiNUS Files by the due date: <b>10 May 2020, 10pm
SGT</b>. Late submissions will NOT be accepted. </p>

<h3>Grading Guidelines</h3>

<p>The grading of this homework is based on the design of your system 
(including your method for document collection), the correctness of your implementation, the quality of the search 
results and the documentation.</p>
</ul>

<H3>Hints</H3>

<UL>

  <LI> If there are certain online services or APIs (e.g., web
       services), you wish to invoke in running your system, you
       <strong>can</strong> use these through function calls to
       external services.  You may also wish to pre-compile certain
       (case-specific) resources for use by your system at
       run-time. For using online resources, it maybe helpful to use
       python's utilities to retrieve web pages (URLs), and save it as
       a temporary page for more analysis. You may use temporary file
       names of the form: <code>temp-*.*</code> in the current
       directory for query processing.</LI>

  <LI> While you don't need to print scores out in your final output, you may 
	   find it useful to include such information in your debugging output when
       developing your solution.</LI>
      
  <LI> Bulletproof your input and output.  Note that now the input is only a singe file 
	   instead of a directory. Check that your output is in
       the correct format (docIDs separated by single spaces, no
       quotations, no tabs).</LI>
